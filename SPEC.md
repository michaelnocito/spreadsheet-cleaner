# Spreadsheet Cleaner - Architecture Spec

## Overview

Spreadsheet Cleaner is an offline workbench for pre-migration data quality. It
profiles, cleans, and validates messy CSV / Excel files and exports a
per-dimension quality report. Fully offline: no network calls in the analysis
or cleaning path. One engine, delivered three ways - a `pip` library, a CLI,
and (Phase E) a desktop app.

**Phase B (shipped, v0.1.0):** the profiling engine, robust ingest, type
inference, the data-quality checks, and the HTML / Markdown / JSON report, plus
the CLI and Python API.

**Phase C (shipped, v0.2.0):** the cleaning engine - deterministic a-la-carte
steps, a change log, recipe files (YAML/JSON), a smart default recipe built from
the profile, non-destructive output, a before/after cleaning report, and the
`clean` CLI command / `clean()` API.

**Phase D (shipped, v0.3.0):** migration validation - target schema files
(YAML/JSON) describing the destination's contract, the rule engine (required /
type / length / allowed / pattern / range / unique / lookup, each mapped to a
dimension including INTEGRITY), near-duplicate detection (difflib similarity
with signature blocking, hard row cap), source-vs-cleaned reconciliation
(row counts, key coverage, control totals), a PASS/FAIL validation report, and
the `validate` / `init-schema` / `reconcile` CLI commands.

## Data model (`core/models.py`)

- `Dimension` - the DAMA data-quality dimensions checked: `COMPLETENESS`,
  `UNIQUENESS`, `VALIDITY`, `CONSISTENCY`, `CONFORMITY`, `STRUCTURE`. Each carries
  a `label` and `description`. `DIMENSION_ORDER` fixes report order.
- `Severity` - `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, with a `rank` for sorting.
- `Issue` - one finding: dimension, severity, optional `column`, title, detail,
  affected `count`, and up to a handful of sample values.
- `ColumnProfile` - name, inferred type and confidence, totals, fill/distinct
  rates, unique-key flag, top values, min/max, lengths, and format breakdown.
- `DimensionStat` - `affected` vs. `applicable` counts; `score` = `100 * (1 -
  affected/applicable)`.
- `QualityReport` - source, sheet, timestamp, version, row/col counts, the list
  of `ColumnProfile`, the list of `Issue`, and the per-dimension `DimensionStat`.
  Computes overall `score` (mean of dimension scores), `grade` (A-F), and error /
  warning counts.

## Scoring

Each dimension scores `100 * (1 - affected/applicable)`, where the denominator is
the number of values that check applied to (e.g. present cells for validity, rows
for uniqueness). Overall score is the mean of the six dimension scores; grade is
A (>=95), B (>=85), C (>=70), D (>=50), else F. The report shows the
affected/applicable basis for every dimension so the number is defensible.

## Ingest contract (`core/io.py`)

- Everything loads as **strings**; blanks are preserved as empty strings.
  Nothing is silently coerced or dropped - the profiler sees the raw file.
- CSV: encoding sniff (`utf-8-sig`, `utf-8`, `cp1252`, `latin-1`), delimiter
  sniff via the python engine.
- Excel: `openpyxl`, sheet selectable by name (first sheet default), sheet list
  reported. `zipfile.BadZipFile` is caught and explained (the OneDrive
  not-yet-downloaded trap).
- Fully-blank rows are dropped and counted; a cell is missing if it is
  null/NaN or whitespace-only. Placeholder nulls (`N/A`, `-`, ...) are detected
  as present-but-likely-missing.
- Errors raise `LoadError` with a human-readable message. No stack trace reaches
  the user.

---

## API and CLI contract

- `from spreadsheet_cleaner import profile; report = profile(path, sheet=None)`
  returns a `QualityReport`.
- `from spreadsheet_cleaner.report import render, write` renders a report to a
  string (`render(report, "html"|"md"|"json")`) or writes files (`write(report,
  out_dir, formats)`).
- `spreadsheet-cleaner profile FILE [--sheet] [--format html,md,json] [--out DIR]
  [--open] [--quiet]`. Exit code is `1` when the file has hard errors (so CI can
  gate on it), `2` on load failure, `0` otherwise.

---

## Non-negotiables (see CLAUDE.md)

- No network calls in ingest, profiling, or reporting.
- Read-only: the profiler never modifies the source file. When cleaning lands
  (Phase C) it writes a copy and a change log; it never overwrites the source.
- Every finding maps to a `Dimension`. If a check does not fit a dimension, the
  dimension list grows deliberately, not the check.
- All output is portable and offline: the HTML report embeds its own CSS, no CDN.
